    {
        paragraph: `During my recent interview, I faced a mix of technical, logical, and behavioral questions. It started with a round of introductions where I briefly spoke about myself, my academic background, and the projects I have worked on. The interviewer was particularly interested in my projects, asking me to explain them in detail, the challenges I faced, and how I resolved them. In the technical round, I was asked about OOP concepts like polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance. I was also given a coding challenge to write a program for the Factorial. In SQL, the questions revolved around joins, and writing a query to find the Max salary in a table. The interviewer tested my understanding logically by asking a question like filling an empty bucket with exactly 7 liters of water using 5 and 4-liter jars. The behavioral round focused on questions like "Are you willing to relocate?" and "Would you be comfortable working night shifts?" I was also asked how I handle challenges during group projects. Finally, I was asked if I had any questions for them. It was a good experience that tested both my technical and interpersonal skills. The key takeaway for me was the importance of preparation and confidence in explaining my thought process.<br>

After some HR-type questions, we moved to the technical aspect. I was asked to code a simple program, which I completed, and then I added test cases. The interviewer then gave me a database retrieval question, and I provided the SQL query. After he was satisfied with my technical side, he asked theoretical questions based on OOP, DBMS, and core concepts (medium level). The interview ended with personal questions.<br>
